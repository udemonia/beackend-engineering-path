# Branching

## Master

> Should be the stable version of your code

## staging and commits

git add .

git commit -m "a note about the commit"

## branching

If you're on the master branch, you might want to make changes to a clone, preserving the master branch and its inherent stability

git branch {{ name }} _create a branch_

git checkout -b {{ new branch name }} _create and checkout a new branch_

git branch -a _see all open branches the * means you're on the branch_

git checkout {{ branch name }} _switch to a branch_

git branch -d {{ branch name }} _remove a MERGED branch_

git branch -D {{ branch name }} _remove a un-merged branch_

## merging branches

You have to be on the branch you want to merge the updated branch into

git checkout master

git merge {{ branch name }}

notice the two different merge updates:

``` js
 Brandon: ~/dev/backend-engineering-roadmap [git:main]
ðŸ’¡ $git merge working-on-linux
Updating e052873..19a214e
Fast-forward
 basics-git/branching.md | 12 +++++++++++-
 1 file changed, 11 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

``` js
 Brandon: ~/dev/backend-engineering-roadmap [git:main]
ðŸ’¡ $git merge working-on-git
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 basics-git/testing-branches.js | 0
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 basics-git/testing-branches.js
```

if your main/master branch changes after your branch it has to use a different strategy to merge them

## conflicts

if someone edits the css document on main/master while you're editing it on a branch, a conflict will occur

You'll be notified via the terminal and expected to fix the code manually

``` css
body{
    background: red;
<<<<<<<<<<<< HEAD
    margin: 20px;
================
    padding: 2px;
>>>>>>>>> {{ branch name }}
}
```

it doesn't know which feature we want, we need to help it decide

``` css
body{
    background: red;
    margin: 20px;
    padding: 2px;
}
```

update the code manually, like above, resolving the conflict and commit

## git log

``` js
 Brandon: ~/dev/backend-engineering-roadmap [git:main]
ðŸ’¡ $git log --oneline
