## Standard Input v Standard Output & Data Stream

data streams - - - -  standard data stream

non data stream ------

> standard input, by default, is associated with the keyboard


standard input - - - - - >   command  - - - - - > standard output

standard input - - - - - >   command  - - - - - > standard error

command line inputs ----->   command  ----------> standard output

command line inputs ----->   command  ----------> error output

redirection

you can change where a data stream goes - like updating a stream of water ðŸ’¦

> cat man

"With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input."

so if we don't pass cat a command option we will read the text form standard input (the keyboard)

that is why you get the blinking cursor which just turns displays what you're typing

because we can redirect data streams, we can tell it where to get its data from

**All the POWER** _the ability to combine data streams is what make it so powerful_

connecting outputs to inputs is called **piping** - we're building a pipeline of data.

### SUMMARY

there are two ways to get data into a command and 2 ways to get it out

by default standard output and standard error are attached to your terminal by default, can be changed

standard input is attached to the keyboard by default, this can be changed

## Redirection

The most powerful ability ðŸ‘¾

Pipeing & Redirection

> cat 1> output.txt

take the output from data stream number 1 and pipe it to output.txt

> > or >> (overwrite or append)
